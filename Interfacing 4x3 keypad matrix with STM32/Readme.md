# Interfacing a Keypad Matrix with STM32F401RETx  

Welcome to the **Keypad Matrix Interfacing** project! This repository demonstrates how to interface a keypad matrix with the STM32F401RETx microcontroller, including setting up GPIOs, scanning the keypad, and visualizing outputs.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**  

This project includes:  
- Initialization of a **4x4 Keypad Matrix** with STM32 GPIO pins.  
- Writing efficient **Embedded C code** for keypad scanning.  
- Simulating the design in **Proteus** for validation.  
- Building and generating the final executable hex file for microcontroller programming.  

The project is designed using **KEIL µVision** without the HAL library, ensuring full control over the STM32 hardware.

## 📑 **How to Run**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keypad-stm32.git
   cd keypad-stm32
   ```  

2. Build the project:  
   - Open the `src/main.c` file in KEIL µVision.  
   - Compile the code and locate the hex file in the `build/` folder.  

3. Load the Proteus simulation:  
   - Open the `.pdsprj` file in the `simulations/` folder using Proteus.  
   - Run the simulation and observe the functionality.  

4. Flash the hex file to STM32:  
   - Use ST-Link or a similar debugger/programmer to upload the hex file from the `build/` folder.  

5. Connect hardware:  
   - Follow the circuit diagram provided in the `docs/` folder to connect the keypad and STM32F401RETx.  
   - Power on the circuit and test the keypad functionality.
