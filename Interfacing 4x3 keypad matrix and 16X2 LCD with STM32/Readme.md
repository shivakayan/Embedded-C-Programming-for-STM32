# Interfacing 4x3 Keypad Matrix and 16x2 LCD with STM32

Welcome to the **Interfacing 4x3 Keypad Matrix and 16x2 LCD with STM32** project. This project demonstrates how to interface these peripherals with the **STM32F401RE** microcontroller using Embedded C programming. The project is designed to be implemented without using the STM32 HAL libraries, focusing on GPIO configuration and low-level control.

This folder is a part of the [**Embedded-C-Programming-for-STM32**](https://github.com/shivakayan/Embedded-C-Programming-for-STM32) repository.
